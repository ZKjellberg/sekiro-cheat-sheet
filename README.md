This checklist was created by adopting the source code from the [Dark Souls 2 Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/smcnabb/dark-souls-2-cheat-sheet/tree/gh-pages) created by [Stephen McNabb](https://github.com/smcnabb).

The walkthrough is thanks to [DeathGodGarra's NPC Side Quests Guide V2](https://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/168566-dark-souls-iii/73599466).

## Contribution Guide

If you are interested in contributing to this guide, I welcome Pull Requests.

For some background on how the guide code is written, here is a sample item on the checklist:

```
<li data-id="playthrough_13_20" class="f_gem f_misc">Continue left until you can enter a room with a Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier and a Raw Gem</li>
```

The **data-id** is a unique ID used to store the user's progress. For example, ***playthrough_13_20*** is the 20th task in zone 13. New data-ids must be used in ascending order, but you can place the new entries anywhere within a zone.

The **class="f_gem f_misc"** field is used for the filtering system. This task provides the user with a gem and a consumable, so we use **f_gem** and **f_misc**. The full list of filter classes is:

| Class   | Description |
|---      |--- |
| f_boss  | Boss fights |
| f_npc   | NPC side quests |
| f_estus | Estus Shards |
| f_bone  | Undead Bone Shards |
| f_tome  | Sorcery Scrolls, Pyromancy Tomes, and Divine Tomes |
| f_coal  | Coals |
| f_ash   | Umbral Ashes |
| f_gest  | Gestures |
| f_sorc  | Sorceries |
| f_pyro  | Pyromancies |
| f_mirac | Miracles |
| f_ring  | Rings |
| f_weap  | Weapons, Spell Tools, and Shields |
| f_arm   | Armor Sets or individual pieces |
| f_tit   | Titanite |
| f_gem   | Gems |
| f_cov   | Covenants |
| f_misc  | *any other items* |

If none of these filter classes match, use **class="f_none"**.

In addition to the filter classes, there is a second type of classes used to control the visibility of entries based on which playthrough the user is on:

| Class  | Description |
|---     |--- |
| h_ng+  | items hidden on NG+ and beyond, e.g., Ashen Estus Flask |
| s_ng+  | items shown on NG+ and beyond, e.g., +1 rings |
| s_ng++ | items shown on NG++ and beyond, e.g., +2 rings |
